2.52: Here he goes reading my CV,
5.146: he'll find out I was in HR like him.
7.485: But my luck turned upside down,
8.945: and now I'm the one looking for a job.
11.663: He's reading to find a loophole.
14.536: But who is he trying to fool,
this is my zone!
16.598: Do you see the greatness
and the Academic degree?
18.828: And all the courses and experience?
21.143: Look below...Look at it.
23.72: He'll ask me the same old questions,
25.355: What will I offer the company? Everything.
27.365: Place of residence?
Right next to the company.
29.314: I have no salary expectations.
30.76: If you're a man, reject me.
33.317: He'll surely ask why I left my job,
36.689: I can't tell him that
they caught me crying in the bathroom,
39.73: and called me CryBaby Kareem.
43.196: If he asked me where do I
see myself in 5 years,
46.026: I'll tell him so coldly,
48.388: that I see myself everywhere!
58.775: What's HR short for, anyway?
Hany Ramzy?
61.287: or Happy Ramadan?
62.673: Focus!
64.032: What are you waiting for? Ask me.
66.425: I'm ready for anything...
69.058: you'll say.
70.624: Kareem, introduce yourself.
75.627: -I have to go.
-Mr. Kareem!
79.11: It feels good to beat an HR like you.
82.91: I left him to think and prepare replies.
85.423: Then I surprised him
with a very simple question,
88.308: that he didn't see coming.
91.438: I want to cry in the bathroom.
102.695: Hello, my dear viewers,
104.28: welcome to a new episode of ElDaheeh.
106.809: In the 17th centuries, a European war
spiraled out called the Thirty Years' War.
111.05: As usual, France witnessed
some of this war's battles,
114.669: although the French weren't
an active part of that war.
119.526: Anyway, this war had
mercenaries from Croatia,
122.878: to serve King Louis XIV.
125.084: They used to tie a piece of fabric
around their neck for protection,
128.056: so the French saw that tie,
131.282: and called it "Croats", after the Croatians.
134.301: And since the French
have different pronunciations,
137.153: and say the "R" differently,
138.94: the word became "Cravat" instead of "Croat".
141.451: -Isn't this the suit tie, Abo Hmeed?
-Yes!
143.247: The men fashion symbol
that's still standing for unknown reasons!
147.843: Paulo Coelho in his novel,
"Veronika Decides to Die",
150.726: says about the tie that it's "a
ridiculous useless bit of colored cloth...
156.14: tied in a very complicated way...
158.056: and makes it harder to get air to
the lungs and difficult to turn the head."
161.071: And it also requires attention,
if you're passing by a fan or something,
164.39: it could get caught in it and strangle you!
166.794: If a mad man asks me
why am I wearing a tie,
169.2: I won't find a logical explanation to say,
171.17: except the comfort of taking it off at home.
173.817: Imagine wearing it to
feel comfort when taking it off.
176.419: The tie is a symbol
for all awkward situations,
179.732: ones that require looking
serious and committed,
183.136: and in many other situations.
184.721: Going to propose? wear a tie,
Going to a seminar? wear a tie.
187.681: And the hardest situation, the one
I'm building up for, a job interview.
191.825: And as you expected,
it is our episode's star today,
194.756: Job interviews.
197.131: An interview is that evil invention
created by Thomas Edison during the 20s,
202.861: which was agreed upon by all sources.
204.371: The idea of the interview
is said to belong to Edison,
207.155: and depends on testing
his job applicants in his office.
211.253: At that time, the New York Times
exposed his method,
213.733: and published the questions
he used to ask ask the applicants,
217.841: which were hard
and almost impossible to answer.
220.699: I lied to you, my friend.
221.594: Edison neither invented
 this personality test,
224.11: nor was the brains
behind the interview idea.
225.898: Edison took this personality test
from the army during World War I,
228.659: then developed it,
230.514: and made a uniform employment test in 1921.
234.488: The interview isn't even an invention,
236.627: people have always been questioned,
asked, and interviewed.
240.226: It's as old as human relationships go.
242.44: Edison just polished it for his age,
243.966: the industrial revolution age and after.
247.145: Before that, most of the jobs were crafts,
passed down between families' generations,
250.57: or families would send their kids to
learn a craft at other families, apprentices.
254.135: And mostly the one who ran
the factory or the workshop,
256.742: or the hospital or the bookstore,
was its direct owner.
259.595: But after the industrial revolution
and capitalism,
263.024: role dividing in work appeared.
264.8: That way, there was production lines
266.997: in addition to developing management
systems and service sectors step by step.
270.543: Then new job came out
like sales, marketing,
273.608: and of course the famous, HR.
276.276: What's HR, Abo Hmeed?
abbreviation for Happy Ramadan?
279.166: No, my friend, it's for Human Resources.
281.172: It seems like
you weren't fired before.
282.356: Anyway, companies grew
and started needing to hire many employees.
287.015: So we needed to find a way
to filter out these applicants,
292.148: and a kind of formula to evaluate them,
294.804: and see if they're fit for the job.
296.968: That's when the interviews
started with all their tests.
299.47: And it became a standard measure
for more than a 100 years.
301.947: According to many studies,
interviews are more prone to be subjective,
306.419: they're not objective.
307.609: It doesn't have specific standards
and numbers that are agreed on everywhere.
311.778: It's more up to the interviewer.
313.541: It's subjective, he may like you
and offer you a job without being qualified,
317.062: or vice versa,
318.624: whether it would be because of
your name or race or way of talking.
323.63: Biasing and unstandardized
results became inevitable.
328.848: But despite all that,
the interview is one of the key tools
332.145: and measures to choosing fit employees.
335.382: As Forbes say, the world spends over 200
billion dollars on employment services.
341.213: Third of that amount
is attributed to USA alone,
342.933: that spends around 72 billion dollars
on these services.
346.37: What's with that, USA?
348.172: You know when you apply for a job
and get no reply at all?
350.822: That hard feeling
that you went through a lot.
352.87: Let me break it down for you with numbers.
354.352: I'll break down your failure with numbers.
357.42: It's said that among 6 applications,
360.477: only one interview is offered.
362.765: If you're manly enough.
363.684: My friend, I'm not attacking you, cool down.
366.055: Not challenging you,
just mentioning gender.
367.719: Because for women, it's
one interview offer out of 9 applications,
372.067: even if the professional background and job
experience between both genders are equal.
377.739: Capitalism doesn't like you,
my female friend.
380.059: They're probably jealous.
381.248: Anyway, you my male or female friend,
383.356: if you got interview offers, your
acceptance rate are from 10% to 37%.
389.157: And if you got lucky and scored 3 interviews,
391.947: the acceptance rate would be 51%.
394.217: Man, why so cruel Abo Hmeed?
396.477: A company usually receives
398.302: around 250 CVs for every job vacancy,
401.612: and only 6 of them get offered interviews.
404.55: There are 244 CVs discarded.
406.922: Each CV is approximately
checked out for average of 6 seconds.
412.894: -Only?
-Yes, my friend.
414.2: 6 seconds are usually enough
to decide interviewing you or not.
419.336: And it's said that 76%
of CV discarding at the first glance
423.419: is the unprofessional E-mail address.
426.365: The whole "Ahmed_love_2010" thing
429.515: doesn't work at all.
430.938: If some people still have hotmail,
434.563: that's enough,
435.651: There's no more NaughtyBoy_ShawnMichaels.
438.73: Statistics also tell us
that 85% of job applicants
444.115: lie on their CVs
to make themselves seem cooler.
447.639: And 95% of the job applicants
450.002: try to pass younger than they really are.
452.528: Because discrimination
against older people is real,
455.363: even in a land
of equal opportunity like USA,
457.778: where you're neither allowed
to write your date of birth
461.077: nor your picture on your CV.
462.512: You know my friend that a lie has no legs.
464.92: So, no pants are needed, Abo Hmeed?
467.613: Especially in this social media age,
469.399: it's hard to lie about these things.
470.796: It's not easy to hide your info.
472.511: Keeping in mind that 70% of recruiters
476.522: skim through the applicants'
social media accounts,
479.34: and 43% of the HR recruiters
481.609: regularly keep an eye on
their employees on these platforms.
484.208: Careful about what you post now.
486.209: One of the important platforms is Linkedin.
489.736: Anyway, if you passed all that,
491.428: and made it to the interview,
492.874: the most important thing is preparation.
496.218: And after you're done, prepare again.
498.219: You have to do your research
on the job and the company.
500.925: It doesn't make sense at all
502.675: in an interview to ask questions like
504.488: "What do you do in this company?"
506.187: Something like that is a deal breaker.
508.029: You can't go to an interview
where you don't know what the company does.
511.434: Keep in mind that 47%
of interview rejections
515.384: is because people don't know enough
about the company's activity or products.
519.65: You have to be well-prepared,
521.89: expect the questions and their answers.
524.018: Most of these questions are all over
books, researches, and websites.
526.698: One would say, "Abo Hmeed,
I memorized all answers and ready."
529.808: Calm down, naive-o.
531.214: Calm down.
532.385: The answers can't be told
as memorized not understood.
536.511: You have to understand
the answers and rephrase them.
539.474: That's like when you cheat
from your friend in an exam,
541.846: and you change in your answer
so no one knows you cheated.
544.926: The performance in delivering
the answer has to be articulate and natural.
547.818: Know that no matter
how smarty-pants you try to be,
549.944: you're talking to professionals,
551.876: who have been through tons of this.
553.592: You're not just trying,
there aren't many eggs in the basket,
556.098: you have to be prepared to claim
the first place in a race with many people.
559.98: And honestly, you have little time window
to leave a good first impression.
563.978: The impression, my friend.
565.822: Your first glance and
fraction of a second make a difference.
569.493: What are we doing again, Abo Hmeed?
570.787: The outfit, the eyes,
the body language, and the smile,
573.771: don't do silly things, just don't.
575.845: If your outfit is inappropriate,
this could blow your shot.
578.834: "Outfit"
For example, in 71% of the time,
580.961: you don't have to wear formal
as in a full suit, shirt, and tie.
583.35: You should ask about
the dress code of that company instead,
585.991: and what do people there
expect you to wear.
588.155: If you aren't making good eye contact,
590.93: "Eye contact"
you'll be rejected 67% of the time.
593.756: "Body language"
Even if you just crossed your arms,
596.198: you're giving 20% of rejection.
598.901: You wasted 20% and have 80% left.
601.338: "Smile"
The smile is important, so as your tone.
604.489: As simple as these things are,
606.448: they make up 50% of your chances.
608.282: Generally, your self confidence
610.395: and your ability to show it
without excessiveness or arrogance,
615.232: it makes a difference.
616.187: There are even 10% of applicants that
get rejected because of their handshake.
620.303: Learn how to shake hands.
621.396: While you're learning to handshake,
learn how to smile.
623.367: In a study of The Journal
of Social Psychology in 2015,
626.842: with a very interesting title,
628.474: "Smiling in a Job Interview:
When Less is More"
634.572: Don't smile too much,
you'll look like an idiot.
636.58: In this study they found that
smiling is less mid-interview,
639.862: comparing to its beginning and end,
641.348: which helps in getting accepted
642.85: especially in jobs requiring seriousness.
644.462: According to that study and some cases,
647.17: smile when you're entering and leaving,
649.17: and don't smile much
during the interview's serious talk.
652.007: The study concluded
that your smile in the interview,
654.437: affects your acceptance status
based on the type of the job itself.
657.855: The interview lasts average of 40 minutes,
659.993: with a range of 30 to 90 minutes.
662.082: If you lasted to the maximum range,
664.473: it's a good thing,
665.581: and that you passed the phase
where they could have rejected you,
668.147: so they're taking their time,
669.26: and they definitely are
because they like you,
671.097: they won't waste their time
with you then reject you.
673.194: But my friend, the crucial interview
interval is the first 90 seconds.
677.075: If their maximum is 90 minutes,
679.514: then 33% percent of the time, they decided 
to reject someone in those first 90 seconds.
683.788: Some statistics estimate 7 seconds
686.395: as an average for the first impression.
688.283: They know the waters of
the person in the first  seconds.
690.581: Why is he here? What does he want?
Is he good or not?
693.162: It's not always an accurate impression,
but it's formed in those 7 seconds.
697.61: And here, unfortunately,
perception is reality.
700.0: The first 7 seconds, according to the study,
are more important than the entire interview.
703.759: That's if you survived
15 minutes in the first place.
705.887: You need to keep in mind
the idea of elimination,
708.882: where mostly the aim of
the first few minutes and questions,
712.001: and some first interviews
if the recruiting is multi-phased,
715.947: is for the goal of elimination.
718.046: Calm down, elimination as an employee
not a CIA agent.
721.092: Companies usually want to get rid
of a specific number to filter the others.
725.192: They play the golden goal
in round-16 on you,
727.48: bam a Knockout decider,
728.419: if you answered wrong, goodbye.
729.739: And take care of the trap question,
731.282: "Tell us your strengths and weaknesses"
734.09: and gives you that look
that we all have weaknesses.
736.849: My friend, don't answer that question
738.957: if anyone ever asked it.
740.684: The best answer to that question,
742.332: is to mention something related to work.
744.836: Something technical you want to gain.
746.544: Stay away from your personal life
and weak responses
749.275: like saying you have no weaknesses.
751.283: That one's called Thanos,
You're not him.
752.689: Choose something that has two sides.
754.437: You can say that your problem
756.095: is that you don't tolerate
slow pace from colleagues,
758.381: but you respect the team spirit,
760.033: and you worked on a way
to help them work faster.
762.867: Then you talk about an example
 you did in a job before.
765.162: That way, you mentioned a weakness
766.848: and worked out a solution for it,
768.285: and that solution improved both
you and your team's performance.
770.637: Try to use the story-telling
method in an interview.
773.946: Have every story formatted
by the STAR technique,
776.738: S situation, T task,
779.735: A action, R result.
783.21: If you want to answer the weakness
question spontaneously, feel free to do so.
786.857: But stick to business.
788.906: That's important,
according to studies not me.
791.917: My dear friend, there are somethings we
don't do in an interview or on a first date.
795.897: Don't voluntarily spill your flaws.
797.359: Let them find out on their own,
it won't be that hard.
799.962: And don't spill a secret,
don't say you have a difficulty waking up,
803.958: or that you're used to being late.
805.608: Keep this till the firing day.
807.166: They'll know everything then.
808.403: Remember,
813.506: people are hired for their skills,
815.685: and fired for their attitude.
817.739: -For what, Abo Hmeed?
-Their attitude.
819.41: Apply all this advice in all questions/
821.26: Like introduce yourself
that we all stutter in,
824.573: and the one about your strength
or ability to work under pressure.
827.667: I want you to keep
your answers focused on work,
831.273: not your personal matters.
832.5: You're not with your therapist,
834.75: nor with Opera.
835.903: Tell stories in the context of work.
838.54: And try to do that professionally,
840.179: don't make the interviewer
sense that you're connecting dots,
842.935: don't scheme it geometrically,
do it free hand, smoothly.
846.243: Use strong words, like loyalty,
team spirit, leadership,
849.84: efficiency, and customer satisfaction.
851.531: No personal talk.
853.058: One more thing, don't bad-mouth
your old job even if you left with a fight.
856.63: It was just a misunderstanding.
859.405: No details, let be bygones be bygones.
861.887: Don't be mischievous or pessimist,
864.172: don't speak from the heart without planning.
866.689: Don't let them find fake promises,
be realistic and dignified.
870.33: Not just that, there are also
the technical questions, very important.
873.509: We get hired for our skills,
875.491: and fired for our attitude.
876.828: Also watch out from the IQ questions,
878.696: "how to fit in 3 elephants in a mini car"
880.954: and "what's the money's color".
882.113: Most importantly, don't respond "I don't
know" to a technical work-related question,
886.595: and don't say any answer,
think and talk it through with them.
889.033: Buy yourself some time
to understand what they want.
891.075: In the end it's a discussion
and a conversation
893.285: They need you as much as you need them.
895.958: It's not an interrogation.
Believe in yourself.
898.802: Also, when you answer the IQ questions,
900.43: respond to the question with a question,
902.027: as in you're inquiring to understand more.
903.828: Lastly, with the last and known question,
907.415: which is where do you
see yourself in 5 years.
909.847: Know that this question is about two things,
912.395: your idea on job stability,
914.108: and your understanding
of their investment in an employee.
918.041: You want to get promoted, and your plan
might take two and a half years at most,
921.599: and your ambition is to be
in your interviewer's position,
923.75: all that doesn't matter
and you shouldn't say it nor hint it.
926.712: You're there to earn
a living not spark drama.
928.572: Don't mind the administrative hierarchy.
930.787: You need to use
your answer to show your loyalty.
933.71: They will invest their
money, training, and time on you.
936.14: Talk about your plans
to learn, comprehend,
938.508: self-development, self-assertion,
940.453: and finally, gaining as
much experience as possible,
943.18: hence acceptance and respect.
945.248: Talk about enjoyment as well,
947.958: tell them you're looking to grow there.
950.214: And if a chance came to promote,
952.216: I would like to prove myself
and show my skills and abilities.
955.339: Remember that what's
more important than personal ambition,
957.725: for them, is that you're there to stay.
961.004: I want you to be phenomenal, my friend.
963.786: Make the committee applaud
on their inside and say "That's the one".
967.016: And take an initial decision of hiring you.
968.505: Interviews, as said by Joyce Lain Kennedy,
in her book "Job interviews for dummies"
973.123: that it's "a slice of performance art".
975.336: So I need to be
a good performer, Abo Hmeed?
977.712: Unfortunately my friend, let me
tell you that to go through this life,
980.988: you need to be a good performer.
982.388: You, my friend, are like an actor on stage,
984.746: you aren't just skimming
